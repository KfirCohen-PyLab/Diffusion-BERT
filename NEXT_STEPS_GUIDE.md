# üéâ What to Do After Training Your Diffusion BERT Model

Congratulations! You've successfully completed moderate training of your Diffusion BERT model. Here's your comprehensive guide for next steps.

## üìä First: Evaluate Your Model's Performance

Start by testing how well your model actually performs:

```bash
# Find your model directory (should be something like model_name_bert-base-uncased_taskname_qqp_...)
# Use the best checkpoint for evaluation
python evaluate_trained_model.py --checkpoint ./your_model_dir/best_model.pt
```

**What you'll see:**
- üß™ Custom example tests with different corruption levels
- üîÑ Paraphrase generation quality
- üìä Benchmark scores (aim for >60% for good performance)

**Expected results after moderate training:**
- ‚úÖ **Good (60-80%)**: Ready for practical use
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair (40-60%)**: Needs more training
- ‚ùå **Poor (<40%)**: Requires significant improvements

## üéÆ Second: Try Interactive Generation

Experience your model in action with real-time text generation:

```bash
# Interactive mode - most fun way to test!
python interactive_generation.py
```

**Commands to try:**
```
ü§ñ Enter command: fill The weather is really nice today
ü§ñ Enter command: para I love learning new things
ü§ñ Enter command: complete The best way to learn programming is
ü§ñ Enter command: mask I want to [MASK] a new [MASK] today
```

**What each command does:**
- `fill <text>` - Randomly masks parts and regenerates them
- `para <text>` - Creates paraphrases/variations of your text
- `complete <text>` - Continues/completes partial sentences
- `mask <text>` - Fills in [MASK] tokens you specify

## üöÄ Third: Choose Your Path Forward

Based on your evaluation results, pick your next step:

### Option A: üéØ **Model Quality is Good (>60%)** 
**‚Üí Ready for practical applications!**

#### Use Cases:
- **Text Completion**: Help writing emails, documents
- **Paraphrasing**: Rewrite sentences while keeping meaning
- **Creative Writing**: Generate variations of ideas
- **Data Augmentation**: Create training data variations

#### Try These Applications:
```bash
# Generate multiple versions of customer service responses
para "Thank you for contacting our support team"

# Complete professional emails
complete "I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to"

# Create variations for social media posts
fill "Join us for an amazing [MASK] event this [MASK]"
```

### Option B: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Model Quality is Fair (40-60%)**
**‚Üí Enhance with continued training**

```bash
# Continue training with better settings
python continue_training.py --auto
```

**Enhancement options:**
1. **Quality Boost** - 5 epochs + 64 diffusion steps
2. **Deep Training** - 8 epochs + 128 diffusion steps  
3. **Fine-tuning** - Conservative improvements
4. **Custom** - Your own parameters

### Option C: ‚ùå **Model Quality is Poor (<40%)**
**‚Üí Restart with enhanced settings**

```bash
# Train from scratch with better configuration
python run_conditional_training.py
# Choose option 3 (Deep Training)
```

## üìà Advanced Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Data Strategy**
```bash
# Try different datasets for better results
--task_name QT           # Question-answering pairs
--task_name wiki_alignment  # Wikipedia sentence alignment
--max_samples 2000       # Use more data
```

### 2. **Model Architecture**
```bash
# Experiment with different model sizes
--model_name_or_path bert-large-uncased    # Larger model
--num_steps 128          # More diffusion steps
--word_freq_lambda 0.3   # Stronger frequency guidance
```

### 3. **Training Technique**
```bash
# Advanced training settings
--lr 1e-5               # Lower learning rate for stability
--batch_size 4          # Smaller batches for memory
--accumulation_steps 8  # Effective larger batch size
--epochs 10             # Extended training
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Model outputs repetitive text
**Solution:** Increase sampling temperature and diversity
```bash
# In interactive_generation.py, modify temperature values
temperature = 1.0  # Higher = more creative
top_p = 0.9       # Nucleus sampling for quality
```

### Problem: Model doesn't follow instructions well
**Solution:** More conditional training data
```bash
# Use QQP dataset for better instruction following
--task_name qqp
--max_samples 2000
```

### Problem: Slow generation speed
**Solution:** Optimize for inference
```bash
# Use smaller batch sizes and fewer diffusion steps for speed
--batch_size 1
--num_steps 16  # Faster but lower quality
```

### Problem: High memory usage
**Solution:** Reduce model and batch sizes
```bash
--batch_size 2
--device cpu  # Use CPU if GPU memory is limited
```

## üéØ Practical Project Ideas

### 1. **Email Assistant**
Create a tool that helps write professional emails:
```python
# Example usage
generator.complete_text("Dear [Name], I am writing to follow up on")
generator.paraphrase_text("I would like to schedule a meeting")
```

### 2. **Creative Writing Helper**
Assist with story writing and brainstorming:
```python
# Generate story variations
generator.fill_masks("The mysterious [MASK] opened the [MASK] door")
generator.paraphrase_text("It was a dark and stormy night")
```

### 3. **Social Media Content**
Create engaging post variations:
```python
# Generate post alternatives
generator.paraphrase_text("Excited to announce our new product launch!")
generator.fill_masks("Join us for [MASK] at our [MASK] event")
```

### 4. **Educational Content**
Generate learning materials:
```python
# Create question variations
generator.paraphrase_text("What is the capital of France?")
generator.fill_masks("The [MASK] of photosynthesis produces [MASK]")
```
